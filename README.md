# Things to Fix: 
  1. Properly deploy to Heroku. I tried many things found in stack overflow and other similar websites to fix my problem, and nothing worked. I even tried giving heroku my MONAYYY and nothing helped. Once I can figure out this solution, it will be deployed. 
  2. Add CSS, due to the difficulty that I had with this project, I barely got it completed by the due date. Once I get the time, I will add to the CSS to make it look better
  3. Finalize the project to show gifs of finished project in the readme. As of now, the project is fully functioning, but not very appealing to look at. Once I fix CSS, I will make GIF's/Videos to show the application in work.
